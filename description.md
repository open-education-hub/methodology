# Methodology

The Open Education Hub methodology contains all of the guidelines for creating high quality, open source educational materials.
The methodology describes the types of content, how the content is used in the various stages of teaching and the required infrastructure.
All the educational content is open source and all of the used tools are either open source or free to use.

## Types of Content

This chapter describes the various forms that the educational content may take form.
Each section details how a specific type of content is to be developed, stored and used.

### Reading

### Media

### Slides

### Quizzes

### Drills

### Tutorials

### Demos

### Projects

## Teaching Stages

This chapter describes how each teaching activity is mapped to different types of content.
Put differently, it shows how each content type is to be used in the various teaching stages.

### Exams

Exams are assessments designed to evaluate learners' understanding and application of the course material.
Exams aim to measure comprehension, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

Examinations can take various forms, including:

* **Written Exams** consist of short answers, essays, or problems to solve.
  They are versatile and are fit various subjects.
  Written exams build on what you've learned earlier.
  Written exams build upon previous learning, but they aren't adaptive and don't personalize the experience for each learner.
  Additionally, they might not be the best choice for assessing complex situations, often leaning towards straightforward questions.

* **Multiple-Choice Exams** involve choosing the correct answer from a set of options, essentially being a compilation of [quizzes](#quizzes).
  You can consider creating two sets of quizzes: one accessible to all for learning purposes, and another separate set reserved for assessment.
  However, this approach is only a short-term solution, as questions may eventually become accessible through leaks.
  Our recommendation leans toward making all quizzes publicly available and concentrating on producing a substantial number of them.
  In this scenario, the question bank saturates the curricula and that even trying to memorise all questions is akin to learning the subject.

* **Oral / Live Exams**: Learners respond verbally to questions from the educator to demonstrate understanding.
  Or they provide a live demonstration to the educator: writing on paper, demonstrating at the whiteboard, demonstrating an experiment.
  This type of exam is highly interactive with constant monitoring and interviewing from the educator.
  This method suits topics that focus on concept comprehension and the cultivation of critical thinking over practical skills.
  However, organizing oral / live exams can be complex as they require multiple examiners and intervals for examination.
  The subjectivity of this format and the involvement of various examiners might raise concerns about impartiality.

* **Practical Exams** revolve around real-world problem-solving and skill demonstration.
  They are most suitable for disciplines that emphasize hands-on learning and seek quantifiable outcomes.
  In comparison to multiple-choice exams which extend from quizzes, practical exams build upon the idea of [tutorials](#tutorials).
  Their purpose is to handle various tasks, whether demonstrated earlier, similar in nature, or involving combinations, all without guidance.
  This exams require dedicated equipment for the learner (laptops, lab equipment, substances etc.).
