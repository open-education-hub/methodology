# Methodology

The Open Education Hub methodology contains all of the guidelines for creating high quality, open source educational materials.
The methodology describes the types of content, how the content is used in the various stages of teaching and the required infrastructure.
All the educational content is open source and all of the used tools are either open source or free to use.

## Types of Content

This chapter describes the various forms that the educational content may take form.
Each section details how a specific type of content is to be developed, stored and used.

### Reading

### Media

### Slides

### Quizzes

### Drills

### Tutorials

### Demos

### Projects

## Teaching Stages

This chapter describes how each teaching activity is mapped to different types of content.
Put differently, it shows how each content type is to be used in the various teaching stages.

### Lectures

### Practical Sessions

### Exams

### Assignments

Assignments are unassisted practical activities that learners undertake individually or in teams over a longer timespan.
Their primary objective is to provide learners the flexibility to work through tasks at their desired speed, allowing them to address gaps in their understanding as they progress.

#### Launching Assignments

The initial phase of launching an assignment involves several essential steps: publishing the assignment details and files, establishing channels for assistance, and ensuring smooth submission procedures. 
All of these steps are arranged beforehand, with the latter two falling under the broader scope of the subject's infrastructure.

In the initial stages of the assignment, most queries pertain to administrative and workflow-related aspects.
Students often seek clarifications about assignment details, including deadlines, the impact on grading, submission process, troubleshooting procedures, and how to ask for help.
An effective strategy is to create a student's guide for assignments that covers general aspects.

Another aspect that my rise questions is the assignment as a whole and its desired goal.
Typically, these questions are broad and not specific to individual tasks; they revolve around starting points and best practices.
Having a clearly defined assignment structure with references can help students recognize the connection between the overall project and the topics explored.

By keeping discussions organized at the start, the assignment's introduction becomes smoother.
It's helpful to prepare documents with answers upfront to tackle anticipated questions.
This approach works best when these resources are easily accessible and referred to in responses.
This practice encourages students to look for solutions themselves in the official information, reducing the need for personal clarifications.

If the preparations made beforehand don't address all questions or if the initial response is emotionally charged, arranging an open Q&A session can be beneficial.
This helps alleviate initial confusion, enhances the student's learning journey, and sets the stage for future support provisions.

#### Providing Support

Assignments are typically designed for individual work, but they often require support from trainers to clarify requirements and prevent students from getting stuck on tasks.
This goal can be accomplished by utilizing platforms to create dedicated channels for assignments:

- Live Chats

  Live chats are spaces for general questions and ideas, not tied to specific tasks.
  They encourage open discussions, helping learners and educators better grasp assignments through interactive conversations.

  Good examples of live chats are [MS Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/), [Discord](https://discord.com/), which also provide video calls features.
  This enables educators to privately assist learners with technical or assignment-related issues through brief video calls.

- Forums ([Moodle](https://moodle.org/))

  Forums offer an organized setting that supports in-depth discussions.
  Through separate threads for each task, information can be retrieved easily without getting lost in the chatter.
  They enhance the community built around the assignment by letting everyone share insights from their experience and offer suggestions.

  Unlike live chats, forums require some oversight from educators to ensure discussions stay on track.

- Q&A Websites ([StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/))

  Q&A platforms provide focused spaces for asking questions and receiving well-structured answers.
  Users can leverage concise solutions to particular queries, while the voting system highlights the most helpful answers.
  These platforms facilitate efficient knowledge-sharing and problem-solving within specialized communities.

- Mailing Lists

  Mailing lists facilitate focused communication by sending emails to a group of recipients, utilizing the familiarity of email for distribution.
  Its main advantage is that it only requires an email address, negating the necessity for an account on a specific platform.
  However, while accessible, they can be considered outdated due to limitations in interactivity and modern communication tools.

#### Grading Assignments

TODO

- Using the automated checker (locally and remotely)

- Soft and hard deadlines

- Antiplagiarism check

- Assignments without an automated checkery
