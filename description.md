# Methodology

The Open Education Hub methodology contains all of the guidelines for creating high quality, open source educational materials.
The methodology describes the types of content, how the content is used in the various stages of teaching and the required infrastructure.
All the educational content is open source and all of the used tools are either open source or free to use.

## Types of Content

This chapter describes the various forms that the educational content may take form.
Each section details how a specific type of content is to be developed, stored and used.

### Reading

### Media

### Slides

### Quizzes

### Drills

### Guides

Guides are pieces of content consisting of detailed steps that are commonly used in practice.

Guides are to be used by learners as tutorials, part of the learning process.
They can be used as tutorial during practical session, with assistance provided to further explaining certain items, or as unassisted self-study.

Guides can also by educators when demonstrating a topic or showcasing a real-world scenario to a live audience.
These demos are typically good ways to capture the attention of learners due to their real-world nature.

Guides consist of:

- text: created by following the guidelines in the ["Reading" section](#reading)
- media: created by following the guidelines in the ["Media" section](#section)
- support files: source code, skeleton files, application support files, fill-in-the blanks, templates

A learner would read the text, view media files and use (hands-on) practice files to get replicate a practical result present by the guide.
When used by an educator as a demo, support files are used for the live delivery;
text and media are used by the educator to prepare before delivery.
