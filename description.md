# Methodology

The Open Education Hub methodology contains all of the guidelines for creating high quality, open source educational materials.
The methodology describes the types of content, how the content is used in the various stages of teaching and the required infrastructure.
All the educational content is open source and all of the used tools are either open source or free to use.

## Types of Content

This chapter describes the various forms that the educational content may take form.
Each section details how a specific type of content is to be developed, stored and used.

### Reading

The reading content type is the most common form of storing educational material (or information, in general).
As the name suggests the content is developed to be read, therefore it comes in the form of text.

To develop reading content we use the [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) and the following guidelines:

- the heading level of a title is given by the number of `#`s that precede it.
For example, the title of a document is preceded by a single `#`, whereas the chapters are preceded by two.
- each sentence is written on a new line.
- paragraphs are separated by an empty line.
- links should be used as hyperlinks by using the `[]()` syntax as in [this example](https://theuselessweb.com/).

To enforce the guidelines we use [automated linter checks](https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter#readme).
Besides the mentioned guidelines, the linter implements checks for other minor style conventions (such as how to define lists, where should new lines be placed and others).
However, for the majority of cases, the above should be sufficient.

When developing such materials we recommend that:

- the reading material be concise, following the "less is more" principle.
- the first sentence of each section describe what is the intended purpose of the section.
- if the reading material can be expressed in a more visual manner, the latter is preferred.
