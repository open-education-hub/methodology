# Methodology

The Open Education Hub methodology contains all of the guidelines for creating high quality, open source educational materials.
The methodology describes the types of content, how the content is used in the various stages of teaching and the required infrastructure.
All the educational content is open source and all of the used tools are either open source or free to use.

## Types of Content

This chapter describes the various forms that the educational content may take form.
Each section details how a specific type of content is to be developed, stored and used.

### Reading

### Media

### Slides

### Quizzes

### Drills

### Tutorials

### Demos

Demos (demonstrations) are practical live activities performed by the educator during presentations.
Educators use demos to present a real-world scenarios in real time, in front of the audience.
They share similarities with ["Tutorials"](#tutorials).
Content of a demo could also be used for a tutorial.
But, whereas tutorial are meant to be followed step by step by learners, to gain practical skills, demos are used by the educator to highlight aspects of a given topic.
Also, tutorials care more about the steps to get to a result, while demos care more about the result.
Think of a tutorial as answering the question "How do I do that? What are the steps I should follow?".
And think of a demo as answering the question "What's happening in the real world? How does it work?"

Demos are meant to be part of live activities such as ["Lectures"](#lectures) and ["Practical Sessions"](#practical-sessions).
They are meant to have a "wow" factor and hook the audience in.
Demos are typically good ways to capture the attention of learners due to their real-world nature.
They are to be blended with presentations and discussions, for a more dynamic and engaging delivery of content.

Because of their similarity to tutorials, demos share a similar structure.
They consist of:

- text: created by following the guidelines in the ["Reading" section](#reading)
- media: created by following the guidelines in the ["Media" section](#section)
- support files: source code, skeleton files, application support files and, generally, files that are to be used by educators during demo delivery

Similar to the tutorial, a demo presents a step-by-step guide to achieving a particular result.
The educator would mostly use the support files during the actual demo delivery.
Test and media content are used by the educator in the preparatory phase;
and also by learners who want to replicate the demo.
