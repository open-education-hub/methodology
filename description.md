# Methodology

The Open Education Hub methodology contains all of the guidelines for creating high quality, open source educational materials.
The methodology describes the types of content, how the content is used in the various stages of teaching and the required infrastructure.
All the educational content is open source and all of the used tools are either open source or free to use.

## Types of Content

This chapter describes the various forms that the educational content may take form.
Each section details how a specific type of content is to be developed, stored and used.

### Reading

### Media

### Slides

### Quizzes

### Drills

### Tutorials

### Demos

### Projects

## Teaching Stages

This chapter describes how each teaching activity is mapped to different types of content.
Put differently, it shows how each content type is to be used in the various teaching stages.

### Lectures

### Practical Sessions

Practical sessions are represented by hands-on activities that learners perform in order to acquire experience.
These activities are typically supervised by a teacher that proposes the practical exercises and evaluates the learner's performance.
The purpose of the evaluation is mainly to provide feedback as opposed to grading the student.

Instances of practical sessions are represented by lab sessions, seminars or workshops.
The format of a practical session may include:

- support material in the form of 
- theoretical explanations and practical examples offered by the teacher
- practical activities performed by the learners
- debates and discussions between students and teacher or between students themselves regarding specific topics
- feedback from the teacher or peers

Teacher preference, institutional recommendations and implementation specifics dictate:

- which types of practical sessions are used
- length of a practical session instance
- format of a practical session

As such, the educational materials used as support for the practical sessions should offer the flexibility of being tailored depending on the teacher's needs.
At the same time, they should be usable in the absence of a teacher as standalone learning materials for self-taught individuals that want to learn by themselves.

A practical session is comprised of a series of topics that the learner must assimilate.
A topic must contain:

- a brief theoretical description (which may contain links to broader explanations) by using [reading content](#reading), [media](#media), and, potentially, [slide](#slides) materials
- one or more practical exemplifications of the described topic by using [demos](#demos)
- one or more [tutorials](#tutorials) where the learner makes the first steps in applying the described topic
- one or more [quizzes](#quizzes) regarding some aspects of what has been presented so far
- one or more [drills](#drills) where the learner applies the presented topic

There is no enforcement on the order in which the above content types should appear in the topic layout because that depends on the nature of the presented topic.
However, we do recommend that the content types are mingled together so that the learner's attention is kept alive.
For example, having a large theoretical description or a large demo may bore some students.
To avoid that, quizzes, drills and tutorials may be sprinkled throught the topic layout to assure more engagement.

Ideally, each practical activity (quiz, tutorial, drill) would be automatically evaluated and feedback would be instantly generated.
For example, in Computer Programming courses, drills and tutorials typically require the student to write programs.
Checkers should accompany these activities to ensure automated verification.
Quizzes, if employed, are automatically checked for correctness.
Therefore, for humanitarian fields of study such as history or philosophy, we recommend using quizzes instead of drills as a form of practical activity.

The number of topics and the ordering in which the topics are presented in a practical session is highly dependent on the nature of the field of study and the preference of the teacher.
As a consequence, we do not have any recommendations regarding this aspect.
However, if the content creator develops materials that have dependencies between them, this should be specified.
