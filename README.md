# Open Education Hub Methodology

Owner: Răzvan Nițu
Reviewer: Răzvan Deaconescu

The Open Education Hub methodology presents the resources and guides to developing, using and maintaining digital educational content repositories.
The methodology is anchored in the use of the open source development model and in developing open educational resources (OER).
The open source development model is concerned about using open source tools, an open process for contributing, reviewing and maintaining content and the fostering of communities around content repositories.
Open educational resources (OER) have the 5R attributes that stimulate the collaborative development and of digital content: retain, reuse, revise, remix, redistribute.

TODO: overview of chapters, how should they be read
TODO: mention that the content of methodology follows the guidelines that itself presents

The table below maps teaching activities with types of content, according to methods used.
Types of content are presented in the [Developing and Organizing Content](chapters/develop-organize/overview/reading/README.md) chapter, while teaching activities are presented in the [Using and Delivering Content](chapters/use-deliver/overview/reading/README.md) chapter.

Methodology must provide answers to the following questions:

- How do I develop / create a digital educational content repository?
- How do I use (as an educator) a digital educational content repository in an actual implementation (course, training)?
- How do I contribute to digital educational content repository?
- How do I curate / manage a digital educational content repository?

There should be a connection with the [flow diagram](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dTv1OhdtyUKy4bymPdfNxB6BpgKxIIlo (documentul OpenEdu - Workflows.drawio)) we created in late 2022.

Also present methodology scope: it doesn't cover teaching methods, grading, or internal details on infrastructure implementation;
methodology covers content-related topics: development, deployment, use, improvement, management.
