# Tests

Tests are assessments designed to evaluate learners' understanding and application of the course material.
Tests aim to measure comprehension, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

Regarding content, an ideal exam must have:

- **good content coverage**

  An ideal exam should ensure that all subjects studied have an equal chance of being included.
  It should essentially mirror the content repository.
  For example, theoretical components might be drawn from sources like [drills](../../../develop-organize/drills/reading/README.md), [reading material](../../../develop-organize/reading/reading/README.md), or [slides](../../../develop-organize/slides/reading/README.md), while practical, hands-on elements, could be inspired by [assignments](../../../use-deliver/assignments/reading/README.md) and [guides](../../../develop-organize/guides/reading/README.md).

- **good difficulty coverage**

  The examination process should be structured in stages, with an initial focus on assessing a foundational level of knowledge.
  Once this fundamental knowledge is established, more complex scenarios can be introduced as challenges.
  These challenges serve to evaluate a student's intuition and their familiarity with advanced concepts.

Grading tests can be a challenging task, which is why automating parts of the process is a practical approach.
The extent to which automation can be implemented largely depends on the medium and format of the examination.

In simple terms, when it comes to close-ended answers on online platforms, automation is already a feasible option, as seen in platforms like [Moodle](https://moodle.org/).
These platforms streamline the grading process and reduce manual work for educators.
Even for open-ended questions, these platforms offer features that allow for answer exports and collaborative grading among educators, simplifying paperwork.
Additionally, they facilitate the efficient transmission of grades to students.

However, it's important to note that an online examination environment comes with its own set of challenges.
Ensuring that students do not resort to external sources for information during the exam is a significant concern that needs to be addressed.

Examinations can take various forms, including:

- **Written Tests** consist of short answers, essays, or problems to solve.
  They are versatile and are fit various subjects.
  Written tests build on what you've learned earlier.
  Written tests build upon previous learning, but they aren't adaptive and don't personalize the experience for each learner.
  Additionally, they might not be the best choice for assessing complex situations, often leaning towards straightforward questions.

- **Multiple-Choice Tests** involve choosing the correct answer from a set of options, essentially being a compilation of [questions](../../../develop-organize/drills/reading/questions.md).
  You can consider creating two sets of quizzes: one accessible to all for learning purposes, and another separate set reserved for assessment.
  However, this approach is only a short-term solution, as questions may eventually become accessible through leaks.
  Our recommendation leans toward making all quizzes publicly available and concentrating on producing a substantial number of them.
  In this scenario, the question bank saturates the curricula and that even trying to memorise all questions is akin to learning the subject.

- **Oral / Live Tests**: Learners respond verbally to questions from the educator to demonstrate understanding.
  Or they provide a live demonstration to the educator: writing on paper, demonstrating at the whiteboard, demonstrating an experiment.
  This type of exam is highly interactive with constant monitoring and interviewing from the educator.
  This method suits topics that focus on concept comprehension and the cultivation of critical thinking over practical skills.
  However, organizing oral / live tests can be complex as they require multiple examiners and intervals for examination.
  The subjectivity of this format and the involvement of various examiners might raise concerns about impartiality.

- **Practical Tests** revolve around real-world problem-solving and skill demonstration.
  They are most suitable for disciplines that emphasize hands-on learning and seek quantifiable outcomes.
  In comparison to multiple-choice tests which extend from [questions](../../../develop-organize/drills/reading/questions.md), practical tests are built on top of [guides](../../../develop-organize/guides/reading/README.md) and [tasks](../../../develop-organize/drills/reading/tasks.md).
  Their purpose is to handle various tasks, whether demonstrated earlier, similar in nature, or involving combinations, all without guidance.
  These tests require dedicated equipment for the learner (laptops, lab equipment, substances etc.).

The mentioned forms are not exhaustive for the exam; they can also be combined to comprehensively address the subject's content.
This approach provides a flexible method of assessment and may be particularly suitable for subjects with diverse forms of teaching, for example subjects that correlate both theoretical and practical concepts.
