# Open Education Hub Methodology

The Open Education Hub methodology presents the resources and guides to developing, using and maintaining digital educational content repositories.
The methodology is anchored in the use of the open source development model and in developing open educational resources (OER).
The open source development model is concerned about using open source tools, an open process for contributing, reviewing and maintaining content and the fostering of communities around content repositories.
[Open educational resources (OER)](https://oercommons.org/) have the 5R attributes that stimulate the collaborative development and of digital content: retain, reuse, revise, remix, redistribute.

The methodology provides answers to the following questions:

- How do I develop / create a digital educational content repository?
- How do I use (as an educator) a digital educational content repository in an actual implementation (course, training)?
- How do I contribute to digital educational content repository?
- How do I curate / manage a digital educational content repository?

Note that the methodology is content-centric.
It is focused and provide instructions on the development, deployment, use, improvement, curation and management of educational content.
Aspects such as teaching methods and evaluation are not presented.
These aspects are to be designed according to the specifics and the educator and learning group.

Currently, the methodology consists of 6 chapters:

- [Building Blocks](../building-blocks/overview/reading/read.md)
- [Roles](../roles/overview/reading/read.md)
- [Support Infrastructure](../infrastructure/overview/reading/read.md)
- [Developing and Organizing Content](../develop-organize/overview/reading/read.md)
- [Using and Delivering Content](../use-deliver/overview/reading/read.md)
- [Curating and Maintaining Content](../curate-maintain/overview/reading/read.md)

The first 3 chapters present overall information related to infrastructure resources and conventions.
The actual guides are part of the last 3 chapters, that are related to the three major user roles: content developer, content user and content maintainer.

Content is not meant to be read in a chronological fashion.
Generally, when a particular information is required, such as creating a particular content type, or delivering another content type, the required section would be accessed.

The contents of the methodology, part of this repository, follow the instructions set in the [Developing and Organizing Content](../develop-organize/overview/reading/read.md) chapter.
So the methodology is structured according to its own guides.

The table below maps teaching activities with types of content, according to methods used.
Types of content are presented in the [Developing and Organizing Content](../develop-organize/overview/reading/read.md) chapter, while teaching activities are presented in the [Using and Delivering Content](../use-deliver/overview/reading/read.md) chapter.
