# Communication

Given the goal of maintaining a healthy community around the project, the content curator is in charge of communication with community members.
This is relevant both to build and maintain a community and to spark discussions on improving content, infrastructure and community organizing aspects.

Communication considers different groups, as highlighted in the ["Collaboration" section](../../../infrastructure/collaboration/reading/read.md).

- Public communication related to content
- Internal communication for stakeholder and those with decision making power: educators, content developers, content managers
- Institutional discussions as part of an actual content delivery, taking part between educators and learners

For the public communication and internal communication scenarios, we strongly advise the use of the [Open Education Hub Discord server](https://bit.ly/OpenEduHub).
The content curator will be provided full ownership on the communication channels, with the ability to add members to internal communication channels.

It is also the responsibility of the content curator to organize periodic internal meetings and provide an overall direction and priorities of the community.
We advise such meetings to take place once every 6 months, as they generally fit the semester calendar in universities.
More meetings could happen if required or if deemed useful.

Periodic public meetings can also happen, up to the decision of the content curator.

The content curator will provide summaries of the meetings in the [`meeting-notes` repository](https://github.com/open-education-hub/meeting-notes/).

Apart from Discord-based discussions and meetings, the content curator can use other discussion media such as mailing lists / groups, simple email communication and [GitHub discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions).

The content curator will update the content repository description to provide the required information on the communication media used for the repository.
Instructions on best practices, rules and recommendations for using the communication media will also be provided and enforced by the content curator.
