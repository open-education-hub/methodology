# Community

The use of [communication](../../communication/reading/read.md) media around the content repository is both to build and to maintain a healthy community of educators and learners around the topic of the repository.
The community will serve multiple roles:

- Provide feedback to existing content, new content and to decisions enacted by the content curator and other leaders.
- Submit contributions and do reviews and enrich existing content.
- Take part in the decision making process.
- Provide new ideas for new content, new infrastructure and other support items.

The community will include all types of [roles](../../../roles/overview/reading/read.md).
The content curator will act as a community leader that will involve as many members, particularly experienced and active contributors, content developers and educators, in the decision making process.

The core of the community will consist of educators, learners and contributors / hobbyists.

Is is the goal and the duty of the content curator to engage community members and maintain a vibrant environment.

The content curator is to consistently look to enlarge the community.
To this end, the content curator must periodically take the following actions:

- Advertise the content repositories on social media and other communication media.
- Take part in events, talks, conferences, meetups and hackathons to present the community, the content and the infrastructure.
- Maintain an active connection to educators that use the content, collect feedback and aim to improve it to further the use of the content in educator institutions.
- Engage contributors and reviewers for an effective and timely review process, to stimulate consistent submissions.
- Look for sponsors and funding for content developers and reviewers.

The content curator is to set up a "council" of the community, to assist with the decision making process and share the responsibilities in leading the community.
This is to be organized by the content curator, with recommendations on attracting experienced educators and contributors and those who show interest in taking a more active role.
