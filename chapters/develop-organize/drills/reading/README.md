### Drills

Drills are educational activities designed to reinforce learning through repetitive practice.
While quizzes are assessments aimed at testing understanding, drills involve repeated practice of a specific skill or concept.
The primary goal of drills is to promote mastery and internalisation of skills or knowledge.
By repeating tasks or exercises, learners can reinforce their understanding and enhance their ability to apply learned concepts effectively.
However, it's important to balance drills with other types of learning activities to maintain learner engagement and prevent monotony.
For example, drills can be combined with homework assignments, group discussions, and other activities to provide a more varied learning experience.
The difference is that while drills are repetitive, simple, and focused on a single skill or concept, homework activities can be more complex and open-ended.

Some key considerations when designing drills include:

- **Skill acquisition**: By providing repetitive practice, drills help learners develop accuracy and speed.
- **Reinforcement**: Drills should be used to reinforce skills and knowledge that have already been taught.
- **Building foundations**: By practicing fundamental skills and concepts repeatedly, learners can develop a solid base of knowledge, which can support their learning in more complex areas.
- **Confidence**: Drills can boost learner confidence as they see their progress through repeated practice.
- **Engagement**: Start with simple drills and gradually increase the difficulty level to prevent learners from becoming overwhelmed.

To overcome this limitation, items to consider are:

- **Variety**: Drills should be varied to prevent monotony and keep learners engaged.
- **Feedback**: Students should receive feedback on their performance to help them identify areas for improvement.
- **Critical thinking**: Some open-ended questions can be included in drills to encourage learners to think critically about the material.

There are several ways to organize these drills:

- **Individual drills**: Students complete drills individually, either in class or at home.
- **Group drills**: Students work in groups to complete drills.
- **Competitive drills**: Students compete against each other to complete drills.
- **Timed drills**: Students complete drills within a specified time limit.
