### Drills

Drills are educational activities designed to reinforce learning through repetitive practice.
The primary goal of drills is to promote mastery and internalisation of skills or knowledge.
By repeating tasks or exercises, learners can reinforce their understanding and enhance their ability to apply learned concepts effectively.
Drills share similarities with [projects](../../projects/reading/README.md).
The difference is that while drills are repetitive, simple, and focused on a single skill or concept, projects are more complex, broader in scope and with a larger variety of solutions.

Some key considerations when designing drills include:

- **Skill acquisition**: By providing repetitive practice, drills help learners develop accuracy and speed.
- **Reinforcement**: Drills should be used to reinforce skills and knowledge that have already been taught.
- **Building foundations**: By practicing fundamental skills and concepts repeatedly, learners can develop a solid base of knowledge, which can support their learning in more complex areas.
- **Confidence**: Drills can boost learner confidence as they see their progress through repeated practice.
- **Engagement**: Start with simple drills and gradually increase the difficulty level to prevent learners from becoming overwhelmed.

To overcome this limitation, items to consider are:

- **Variety**: Drills should be varied to prevent monotony and keep learners engaged.
- **Feedback**: Students should receive feedback on their performance to help them identify areas for improvement.
- **Critical thinking**: Some open-ended questions can be included in drills to encourage learners to think critically about the material.

There are several ways to organize these drills:

- **Individual drills**: Students complete drills individually, either in class or at home.
- **Group drills**: Students work in groups to complete drills.
- **Competitive drills**: Students compete against each other to complete drills.
- **Timed drills**: Students complete drills within a specified time limit.

Any sort of repetitive learning item is a drill.
There can be questions with a simple answer, such as multiple choice, fill in the blanks, matching questions;
these questions are easy to grade automatically.
There can be questions with a clear, short answer, that is not easy to be grade automatically.
There can be essays / open-ended questions that require a personal take on a topic.
There can be problems with a statement and a solution that's required to be written down by the learner.
There can be practice items that require the learner to construct a solution as a digital application, a solution that ca be passed through an automated checking and grading system, as presented in [the "Validators and Checkers" section](../../../infrastructure/checkers/reading/README.md).

TODO: mention use cases: lab, lecture, assignments, exams, self study (basically everywhere)

TODO: mention roles: learn / practice, self-assess, actual evaluation
