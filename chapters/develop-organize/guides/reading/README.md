### Guides

Guides are pieces of content consisting of detailed steps that are commonly used in practice.

Guides are to be used by learners as tutorials, part of the learning process.
They can be used as tutorial during practical session, with assistance provided to further explaining certain items, or as unassisted self-study.

Guides can also by educators when demonstrating a topic or showcasing a real-world scenario to a live audience.
These demos are typically good ways to capture the attention of learners due to their real-world nature.

Guides consist of:

- text: created by following the guidelines in [the "Reading" section](../../reading/reading/README.md)
- media: created by following the guidelines in [the "Media" section](../../media/reading/README.md)
- support files: source code, skeleton files, application support files, fill-in-the blanks, templates

A learner would read the text, view media files and use (hands-on) practice files to get replicate a practical result present by the guide.
When used by an educator as a demo, support files are used for the live delivery;
text and media are used by the educator to prepare before delivery.
