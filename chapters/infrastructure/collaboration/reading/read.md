the use of Git, GitHub, communication media

OpenEduHub communication: managed by the curator / maintainer, as shown in [the "Communication" section](../../../curate-maintain/communication/reading/read.md)

educators / learners communication: handled by institutional communication media

contributions would ideally happen in the OpenEduHub repository: both for educators and learners, under supervision of the curator / maintainer [the "Content" section](../../../curate-maintain/content/reading/read.md)
