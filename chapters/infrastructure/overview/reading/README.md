## Support Infrastructure

Descrie elementele de infrastructură:
- Folosirea GitHub pentru dezvoltare colaborativă
- Utilitare pentru generare de conținut (media, slide-uri)
- Componentă (a noastră) de publicare de conținut
- Componentă a noastră pentru verificare de submisii
- Componente pentru organizarea de quizuri
- Validatoare de conținut (linters)
- Integrare în GitHub de componente de validare de conținut și deployment automat
- Forme de recompense digitale
- Comunicare (canal de Discord, discuții pe GitHub) pe subiect / curs

This chapter describes the various technologies used to develop, store, deploy and publish the educational content.

### Third-Party (Open) Tools Employed

As part of content development, delivery and consumption, third-party tools will be used to enhance the educator or learner experience.

Common examples for tools that projects integrate into their workflows:

- file converters
- file generators
- content compilers
- content deployment workflows

#### When Should You use a Third-Party Tool?

- you need to automate a process
- you need external functionality that has already been implemented
- you need to scale out a class use case that can only be done with mature tools

#### What to Look for in an Open Source Project

When choosing a tool to be employed during any phase of the class lifecycle, one has to mind the following factors:

- community involvement in product development
- development history
- adoption from other parties or institutions
- success stories with regards to use cases that are compatible with yours

Open source projects depend on the community to move forward the design and development and goals, based on a stated common use case.
The more community support a project has, the better the odds that it will be a long lived, well rounded solution.

Open source projects can be easily tracked using issue trackers, and versioning systems to determine the maturity of the code base.
Sporadic work on a project or a small person development team mean that the tool will be slow to integrate new features or to do bug fixing work.

Institutional support for a software solution makes it so there is financial interest in developing the software.
If a company or institution's financial outcome depends on a project, there will be more development or funding interest from this company.
For example, when Meta has chosen to use a certain file deployment solution, it was likely for more bugs to be reported and fixed.
