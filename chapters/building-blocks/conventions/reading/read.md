# Conventions

Throughout the methodology we will use certain words and structure for uniformity and readability.
We present here these conventions.

Throughout the text, as also laid out in [the "Overview" section](../../overview/reading/read.md) we will use the words **educator** and **learner**.
We consider these terms to be generic enough to encompass the larger types of deliverers and consumers of educational content: teachers, trainers, professors, mentors, presenters on one side, and pupils, trainees, students, mentees, apprentices on the other side.

The word **repository** is used to represent both an open source repository (such as those hosted on GitHub) and the complete collection of contents, disconnected from their storage environment.

Each topic is allocated it own file / page, with liberal referencing of topics on other pages.
This keeps things all in one place, and it makes it easy for the reader to focus only on the topic of interest.

Where possible and relevant, [roles](../../../roles/overview/reading/read.md) are used to signal who is expected to do a specific action.

Existing repositories are used to showcase each content type or educational activity.
These demonstrate the practical implementation of that topic.
Existing repositories used as examples are:

- [the `operating-systems` repository](https://github.com/open-education-hub/operating-systems)
- [the `ccas` repository](https://github.com/open-education-hub/ccas)
- [the `binary-security` repository](https://github.com/open-education-hub/binary-security)

Concrete examples of directory structures and commands are being used as much as possible.
