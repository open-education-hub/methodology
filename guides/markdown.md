# Guides for using Markdown

Reference content guide

* Use single backticks instead of triple backticks for inline text.
  Use triple backticks for blocks of code / commands.
* Separate block items (lists, snippets of code / commands) by a new line.
  That is, every list of items should be preceded and succeeded by a new line.
  Same goes for blocks of code in triple backticks.
* Separate subsequent commands within a snippet by empty lines.
* When using backticks aim to add the language the snippet belongs to (`C`, `Python`).
  Only use `Bash` for shell scripts, not commands and their output.
  GitHub and other rendering engines will also highlight command output, that may contain keywords (that shouldn't be highlighted as part of the output).
* Use single backticks for commands, function names, arguments, parameters.
* Image sizes
* References / footnotes
