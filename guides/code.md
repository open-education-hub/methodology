# Guides for Writing Code

* follow language conventions
* create coding style / conventions
* use linter / static checker
* proper names
* ending newline
* code has to compile to be committed; it's not necessary to work
* no trailing whitespaces
* consistency: bad way but consistent is much better than two good ways - only indent with tabs or spaces, not both
