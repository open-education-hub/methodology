# Guides for Content Writing

## Formatting Content

- Use one line (and only one line) per sentence.
  That is, a sentence (ending in dot - `.`, colon - `:`, question mark - `?`, exclamation mark - `!`, semicolon `;`) won't be on two lines.
  And a line won't have (parts of) two sentences.
- When listing snippets, aim to end the preceding description paragraph with colon - `:`.
- Use italic font for translations, for alternative names or for de-abbreviations.
- Add a blank line after each section heading.
- Add ending newline.
- No trailing whitespaces.

## Syntax

- Do spell checking (link to Vim).
